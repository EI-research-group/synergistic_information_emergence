These are the files required to recreate the analysis presented in Varley & Hoel, 2020.

library.py is the core function library - it contains the foundational Python code required to replicate these analyses. 

The jupyter notebooks show the decompositions for the logic gates AND OR and XOR and demo how this code might be applied in real life. 

The figure_scripts/ directory contains the scripts used to generate all the figures. 

The lattice.gml files are graph files for the specific 3, 4, and 5-element redundancy lattices. 

The gaussian and deterministic_pid.py files are those scripts used to generate and decompose the two different classes of system.
